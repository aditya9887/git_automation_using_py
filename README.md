# git_automation_using_py
I want to automate the raising diff part in terminal (using Python). Just for ease of developers just write the Branch name and commit message and good to go.
Everyday we raise multiple diffs and everytime typing the same git commands becomes tiresome.
So an attempt to automate the process.
